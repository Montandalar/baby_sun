# Baby Sun texture pack for Minetest

This texture pack replaces the default sun texture with a cartoon sun with a
baby's face in the middle. You may recognise this from a certain children's
television show which starts with T- and ends with -ies. Not to worry, I drew it
myself so it's not *copy*wronged, just kind of wrong in a cursed way because of
my amazing drawing skills.

The pack should be compatible with any game that doesn't set a
custom sun texture. I tested it with a few, and it works with:
* Minetest Game
* Mineclone2 (so should work with other Mineclon* games)
* Repixture
* Hades Revisited

..and probably many others.
